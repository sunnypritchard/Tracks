# Leap


This is a simple C program to determine whether a given year is a leap year. The logic is based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar.

## Overview
A leap year occurs:

- Every year that is divisible by 4
- Except for years that are divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400

For Example:

- 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
- 1900 is not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400)
- 2024 is a leap year (divisible by 4 but not 100)
