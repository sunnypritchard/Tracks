# Tracks

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various programming exercises and challenges. It is organized into subdirectories based on specific problems or topics.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as:
- **An educational resource**: A collection of solved exercises, challenges and projects to reinforce programming concepts.
- **A personal learning log**: A way to document and track progress in learning new programming languages, paradigms, and problem-solving techniques.
- **A reference**: A place to revisit solutions and approaches to common problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing a specific programming language, topic, or problem set.


Each subdirectory typically contains:
- **Source code**: The implementation of the solution.
- **Documentation**: A brief explanation of the problem and the approach used to solve it.
- **Tests**: Unit tests or other testing scripts to verify the correctness of the solution.
